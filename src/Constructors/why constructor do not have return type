What actually happens with the constructor is that the runtime uses
type data generated by the compiler to determine how much space is
needed to store an object instance in memory, be it on the stack
or on the heap.

This space includes all members variables and the vtbl.
After this space is allocated, the constructor is called as an internal
part of the instantiation and initialization process to initialize the
contents of the fields.

Then, when the constructor exits,
the runtime returns the newly-created instance.
So the reason the constructor doesn't return
a value is because it's not called directly by your code,
it's called by the memory allocation and object initialization
code in the runtime.

Its return value (if it actually has one when compiled down to machine code)
is opaque to the user - therefore, you can't specify it
